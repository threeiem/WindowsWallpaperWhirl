#Windows Wallpaper Whirl

Allows for a single click to change the backgrounds in Windows 7, 8, 8.5 and 10. 

## How To

There are a few things that need to be done before this vb script will work. First you must have setup a "Slideshow" Background for Windows. Once that is done and there is more than one image the script when activated by click on the script or a shortcut to the script will change the background for all monitors.

## Updates
7/30/2017 - Support for multiple monitors
7/29/2017 - Support for moving the script other locations
